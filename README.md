## Build & Run via GitHub Repository

### Configuration
1. Download the `.zip` file on the `main` branch from the GitHub Repository.
2. You can choose to either run the server locally or through docker.
	- Using Docker:
		1. Install **Docker**
	- Using local machine:
		1. Install **Maven** and **Java (JDK 11)** on your local machine
		2. Install **MySQL** on your local machine and ensure that it is running in the background
		Install **Flutter** on your local machine and either have a **mobile emulator** open or run the application front-end on a **physically connected mobile device**. 
			Note: If you choose to run the front-end on a physically connected mobile device, you will have to change the `localhost` variable in the `/frontend/lib/config/constants.dart`. This value will vary based on your network IP.

### Steps to build & run on local machine
To run the application on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. For each microservice:
	1. Navigate to their root directory (e.g. `/backend/appointment-microservice/`, `/backend/auth-microservice/`, etc.). This should be where you can find their `pom.xml` files.
	2. When on this path, run the command `mvn spring-boot:run`.
2. Run `main.dart` in the `/frontend/lib/` directory.

### Steps to build & run the docker container
To run the server in a docker container, follow these steps:
1. Open the terminal in the `root` directory of the repository (where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located).
2. Before you run any commands, check that this container does not already exist. If there is already this existing container, remove that container.
3. Run the command `docker-compose up`. This will take several minutes.
4. Once the container is running, the server should be accessible on your local machine through the Docker container.
5. Then, run `main.dart` in the `/frontend/lib/` directory.
